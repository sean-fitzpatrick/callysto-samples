    "### How do we divide using fractions?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you know how to multiply fractions, then you already know how to divide fractions! \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go back to dividing integers,or whole numbers. We know that 10 divided by 2 is 5, because 10 can be split into 2 portions each of which has 5. Now notice that dividing 10 by 2 is the same as taking half of 10. That is,\n",
    "$$\\hskip-60pt 10\\div 2 = 10\\times \\frac12 = 5.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in the equality $10 \\div 2 = 10\\times\\frac{1}{2}$, we took the reciprocal of the second number ($\\frac{2}{1} \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{2}$) then changed the division to multiplication! What is the reciprocal? It's when the old numerator becomes the new denominator and the old denominator becomes the new numerator!\n",
    "\n",
    "That's how division with fractions works too: flip the divisor, the number after the division, and then multiply! \n",
    "\n",
    "## The golden rule of division: *division is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal*\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, what is $10\\div \\frac{1}{3}$? If we apply the rule we just came up with, we find\n",
    "$$\\hskip-60pt 10\\div \\frac13 = 10\\times\\frac31 = 10\\times 3 = 30.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Does this make sense? Recall that when we compute $10\\div 2=5$, what we're working out is the number of groups of 2 we need to make 10. Similarly, the expression $10\\div \\frac13$ is asking how many $\\frac{1}{3}$ pieces can fit into 10 pieces. Since it takes 3 $\\frac{1}{3}$s to make one and 10 ones to make 10, we need $3\\times 10 = 30$ pieces of size $\\frac{1}{3}$ to make 10, therefore $10 \\div \\frac{1}{3} = 10 \\times 3 = 30$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Here are the steps\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 1:\n",
    "Find the reciprocal of the divisor. (By making the numerator the denominator and the denominator the numerator of the second fraction.)\n",

    "Follow the steps to multiply the fractions using either method mentioned earlier.\n",

    ">**C** is for **C**hange the sign from divide to multiply\n",
    "\n",
    "### But why does this work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that division is the opposite of multiplication: dividing by a number \"undoes\" multiplication by that same number. This has a special name, division is the *inverse operation* of multiplication. Here, we are interested in undoing multiplication by fractions. Let's start with an integer example. Consider the multiplication of 10 by 4: $10 \\times 4 = 40$. To undo the multiplication by 4, we divide by 4: $40 \\div 4 = 10$ and we get back to the original number! Same goes for fractions: consider the product $20 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 10$. Dividing by $\\frac12$ should undo the multiplication. Our rule for division says that to divide by $\\frac{1}{2}$, we multiply by $\\frac21 = 2$: $10 \\div \\frac{1}{2} = 10\\times 2 = 20$. Once again, we get back to the original number!\n",
    "\n",
    "If dividing by 4 is equivalent to multiplying by $\\frac{1}{4}$, then it's true that dividing by $\\frac{1}{4}$ is equivalent to multiplying by 4. \n",
    "\n",
    "What if you flip the first number instead of the second? Try it with an example we've alredy solved. Does it change the answer or does the order not matter like multiplication?\n",
    "\n",
    "### But isn't division supposed to make the number smaller?\n",
    "\n",
    "The short answer is, \"Yes, but only if the number we're dividing by is bigger than 1.\" Try thinking of division as repeated subtraction: $2 \\div \\frac{1}{2}$ is asking how many times can we subtract $\\frac{1}{2}$ from 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hskip-60pt \\begin{align*}\n",
    "2 - \\frac{1}{2} &= 1\\frac{1}{2}\\tag{once}\\\\[5pt]\n",
    "1\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} &= 1\\tag{twice}\\\\[5pt]\n",

    "\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} &= 0\\tag{four times}\n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So it took 4 subtractions of $\\frac{1}{2}$ from 2 to reach 0, therefore $2 \\div \\frac{1}{2} = 4$.\n",

    "\n",
    "**This notebook is assuming that you already know how to convert between mixed numbers and improper fractions**\n",

    "Remember that a mixed number is really adding an integer and a proper fraction: $3\\,\\frac14$ is really $3+\\frac14$ as one number. A proper fraction is where the numerator is less than the denominator. An improper fraction is where the numerator is bigger than or equal to the denominator.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the product $\\frac45\\times 3\\,\\frac14$. So one way to carry out the product is to use the distributive property:\n",

    "(Note that we've made use of two skills practised above, without writing them down: we multiplied by 3 by thinking of it as the fraction $\\frac31$, and we cancelled the fours in the product $\\frac45\\times \\frac14$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If it is asked for, we can do one final step, and convert back to a mixed fraction: $\\dfrac{13}{5} = 2\\,\\dfrac{3}{5}$. But that was quite a bit of work. *There must be a better way!* \n",

    "- Unlike addition, multiplying fractions *does not* need common denominators. **DM** – **D**ivision/**M**ultiplication = Denominator **D**oesn’t **M**atter \n",
    "- To multiply to fractions, multiply the numerators, then the denominators, and then reduce if necessary.\n",
    "- It is often easier if you cancel common factors before multiplying the fractions.\n",
    "- Division is the inverse of multiplication. Remember the Golden Rule: division is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal! (flipping the numerator and denominator) **KFC** - **K**eep, **F**lip, **C**hange\n",
    "- Multiplication and division involving mixed numbers is easier if you first convert any mixed numbers to improper fractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the time to master your fraction multiplication and division. It may not seem like it now, but this is a much needed skill that you'll rely on for many years to come. Many careers even use fractions on a daily basis, like chefs or construction workers. As always in math, the more you practice, the easier it gets!\n"
